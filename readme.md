# Javascript Pomodoro Timer

This project was inspired by a very useful app that I use daily, [Pomfocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/). I wanted to create the functionality myself, and this application is the result.

## The Pomodoro Technique

The pomodoro technique is a time management strategy to help a person focus and complete a larger task by utilizing timed focus sessions with small breaks in between each focus session.

The application by default uses a 20-minute working session followed by a 5-minute break, and then repeats. After the fourth working session, there is a 15-minute break. Simply press the button labeled "Start" to activate the timer!
